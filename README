Our tool performs label to offset resolution. It takes an input program that appears similar to Roboto,
but with two key differences:

1. The "label" keyword. Labels of the form `label <string>` can be used in place of numbers to reference where to jump next
2. If a label is instead specified in number form, instead of referencing the line relative to the beginning of the file, it references the line relative to itself. For instance, `Move 1 2` will move, and on success, it will go to the next line, or on failure, it will skip ahead by 2 lines.


The following is a sample program:

label start
    Flip 2 1 end
    Turn Left 1
    Turn Right 1
label mid
    Sense Ahead start 1 Food
    PickUp 1 start
label end
    Sense Ahead 1 start HomeBase
    Move 1 start
    Drop start

label lines do NOT count when jumping relative to a line. For instance, PickUp 1 start will go DIRECTLY to Sense Ahead 1 start HomeBase

negative numbers can be used as labels to go BACK lines



Usage:
cargo run -- <input path> <output path>
