We created a tool that turns a slightly modified version of roboto (known as r+ after this point) into roboto proper.

Our tool resolves text labels and relative offsets to absolute roboto labels. R+ has two key differences:

1. The "label" keyword. Labels of the form `label <string>` can be used in place of numbers to reference where to jump next
2. If a label is instead specified in number form, instead of referencing the line relative to the beginning of the file, it references the line relative to itself. For instance, `Move 1 2` will move, and on success, it will go to the next line, or on failure, it will skip ahead by 2 lines.


The following is a sample program:

label start
    Flip 2 1 end
    Turn Left 1
    Turn Right 1
label mid
    Sense Ahead start 1 Food
    PickUp 1 start
label end
    Sense Ahead 1 start HomeBase
    Move 1 start
    Drop start

label lines do NOT count when jumping relative to a line. For instance, PickUp 1 start will go DIRECTLY to Sense Ahead 1 start HomeBase.
negative numbers can be used as labels to go BACK lines.
Other than labels, the r+ behaves the same way as base roboto.

The r+ source code for our final program is `program.r+`.
The final roboto code for our program is `program.roboto`.
(If semicolons are causing any issues, we have included a version without them in `program-nosemis.roboto`)
Failed (unused) programs can be found in the `failed/` directory. These consist of both R+ and roboto.

We have included a pdf `Strategy_Progress_Reflection.pdf` to outline strategies that we considered for implementation during the project.

Ultimately, our strategy revolved around creating a deterministic path, so that in the event that robots found food, they could simply retrace their steps to get home. We used randomness to establish initial directions each time the robots leave their home base.

Usage:
cargo run -- <input path> <output path>
